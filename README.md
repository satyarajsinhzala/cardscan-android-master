## Installation

We publish our library in the jcenter repository, so for most gradle configurations you only need to add the dependency to your app's build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.getbouncer:base:1.0.5109'
    implementation 'com.getbouncer:cardscan:1.0.5109'
}
```

## Using CardScan

To use CardScan, you create a `ScanActivity` intent, start it, and
get the results via the `onActivityResult` method:

```java
public void scanCard() {
    ScanActivity.start(this);
}

protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    if (ScanActivity.isScanResult(requestCode)) {
        if (resultCode == ScanActivity.RESULT_OK && data != null) {
            CreditCard scanResult = ScanActivity.creditCardFromResult(data);

	    // at this point pass the info to your app's enter card flow
	    // this is how we do it in our example app
            Intent intent = new Intent(this, EnterCard.class);
            intent.putExtra("card", scanResult);
            startActivity(intent);
        } else if (resultCode == ScanActivity.RESULT_CANCELED) {
            Log.d(TAG, "The user pressed the back button");
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding to Your App

When added to your app successfully, you should see the card numbers
being passed into your payment form. This is what it looks like using a standard Stripe mobile payment form:
